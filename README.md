This part concludes my customer segmentation analysis by focusing on segmenting customers with location to identify high and low performing  states for targeted adverts.

state was encoded and segmentation was performed with the various website features and purchase features for indepth analysis and 
various visaualization was created, a state metric heatmap to visualize how each state performed 

An interactive dashboard was created to filter states by their purchase behavior category.
